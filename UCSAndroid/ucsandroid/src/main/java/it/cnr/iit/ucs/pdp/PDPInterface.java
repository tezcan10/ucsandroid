 * in two different ways: the policy can be provided by the ContextHandler or it
 * can retrieve the policy from the PAP. <br>
 * Once the request has been analysed, the PDP has to ask the ObligationManager
 * to convert eventual obligation in a PEP-friendly and PIP-friendly format.
 * Only after this step the response with the obligations can be send to the
 * ContextHandler.
