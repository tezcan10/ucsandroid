/**
 * This is the interface provided by the ContextHandler.
 *
 * The contexthandler allows other parties to communicate with it using these
 * functions::
 * <ol>
 * <li>tryAccess: function called when we want to ask the contexthandler if it
 * is possible for a certain subject to perform a certain action upon a certain
 * resource, it will be called before the effective access to the resource</li>
 * <li>startAccess: function called when the subject effectively tries to access
 * the resource, at first we check if it is still possible for the subject to
 * perform the operation, then we demand the various PIPs the continuous
 * monitoring of the environment in order to notify the CH of any bad event that
 * may happen</li>
 * <li>endAccess: this function can be called autonomously by the PEP or can be
 * triggered by the CH when something bad happens. Whenever this function will
 * be called, the session will be terminated. The request will be evaluated
 * again looking for eventual obligations to be performed.</li>
 * <li>attributeChanged: this function is called by the PIPBarrierMonitor
 * whenever a PIP notifies it that an attribute has changed. It triggers the
 * reevaluation of all the sessions that take into account that particular
 * attribute.</li>
 * <li>messageForPIP: this function is triggered from the RequestManager
 * whenever there is a message that asks something from a PIP. The
 * ContextHandler is in fact the only entity in charge of allowing the various
 * PIPs to communicate with the external world</li>
 * </ol>
